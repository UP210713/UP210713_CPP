## __ðŸ“˜&nbsp;Conclutions__   

This is a fairly complete program that tested my programming knowledge and my patience in cases where the code or instructions I gave did not work as I wanted. But I finish this proyect and actualy the program runs very well, the program have many limitations. This is because I still do not have knowledge about many of the tools that I had planned to use. One limitation that I observed was that I couldn't get the cycle that I had planned to work, restart the game every time I wanted, well at the end of the game, I tried, but I couldn't. Another limitation that I had was not getting the player to have the opportunity to choose if he wanted "X" or "O", this was a little more due to time since it was something that occurred to me a little late. But despite the two limitations that I encountered in the process, the game was developed and it works, and I believe that this will help me in my next project.
